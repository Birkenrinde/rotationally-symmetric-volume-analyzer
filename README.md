# rotationally-symmetric-volume-analyzer
This project provides a Python-based pipeline for calculating the 3D volume of a **rotationally symmetric deformed sphere** from its 2D video silhouette. It offers a complete, open-source solution for analyzing video data where direct 3D measurement is impractical or impossible.
